# Boba-orders-bot
(blank) is a discord bot that gives users a list of boba drinks to choose from, as well as some other parameters (sweetness, size, etc.)
## Requirements
1. There must be a command so that users may see what flavors of boba they  can order
1. Users must be able to send the bot a request for a specific boba flavor with specific parameters (you may have your own syntax for taking this input in, i.e: engineer man's felix bot with polls)
1. The bot must generate a file where it stores all the boba orders
## Extra challenge
If one flavor of boba is very popular, we can assume many will order the same flavor of boba with the same parameters as others, so find a way to compact the size of the file
i.e: If 50 people request a jasmine milk tea with 30% sweetness, save space by doing something other than listing 50 lines of the same order# boba-orders-bot
## Install Requirements
boba-orders-bot works with python 3.6.3
